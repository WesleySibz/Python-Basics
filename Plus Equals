#Python offers a shorthand for updating variables. 
When you have a number saved in a variable and want to add to the current value of the variable, 
you can use the += (plus-equals) operator.

total_price = 0

new_sneakers = 50.00

total_price += new_sneakers

nice_sweater = 39.00
fun_books = 20.00
# Update total_price here:
total_price += nice_sweater 
total_price += fun_books
print("The total price is", total_price)
