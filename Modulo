#Here, we use the modulo operator to find the remainder of division operations. 
We see that 29 % 5 equals 4, 32 % 3 equals 2, and 44 % 2 equals 0.
The modulo operator is useful in programming when we want to perform an action every nth-time the code is run. 
Can the result of a modulo operation be larger than the divisor? 
Why or why not?

my_team = 27%4

print(my_team)
print(26%4)
print(28%4)
