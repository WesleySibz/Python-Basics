Python gives us an easy way of creating these types of lists using a built-in function called range().

The function range() takes a single input, and generates numbers starting at 0 and ending at the number before the input.

So, if we want the numbers from 0 through 9, we use range(10) because 10 is 1 greater than 9:

my_range = range(10)
print(my_range)

# Your code below: 

number_list = range(3)
print(list(number_list))
number_list = range(9)
print(list(number_list))
zero_to_seven = range(8)
print(list(zero_to_seven))
