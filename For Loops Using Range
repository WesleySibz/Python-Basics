We can then use the range directly in our for loops as the collection to perform a six-step iteration:

for temp in range(6):
  print("Learning Loops!")
Would output:

Learning Loops!
Learning Loops!
Learning Loops!
Learning Loops!
Learning Loops!
Learning Loops!

promise = "I will finish the python loops module!"
for p in range (5):
  print(promise)
