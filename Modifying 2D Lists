We will need to modify the list to accommodate the change to our class_name_hobbies list. To change a value in a two-dimensional list, reassign the value using the specific index.

# The list of Jenny is at index 0. The hobby is at index 1. 
class_name_hobbies[0][1] = "Meditation"
print(class_name_hobbies)
Would output:

[["Jenny", "Meditation"], ["Alexus", "Photography"], ["Grace", "Soccer"]]
Negative indices will work as well.

# The list of Jenny is at index 0. The hobby is at index 1. 
class_name_hobbies[-1][-1] = "Football"
print(class_name_hobbies)
Would output:

[["Jenny", "Meditation"], ["Alexus", "Photography"], ["Grace", "Football"]]

#Your code below:]
incoming_class = [["Kenny", "American",	9],["Tanya",	"Russian",	9],["Madison",	"Indian",	7]]
print(incoming_class )
incoming_class[2][2] = 8
print(incoming_class)
incoming_class[-3][-3] = "Ken"
print(incoming_class)
