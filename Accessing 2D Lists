#Let’s return to our classroom heights example:

#heights = [["Noelle", 61], ["Ali", 70], ["Sam", 67]]
#Two-dimensional lists can be accessed similar to their one-dimensional counterpart. Instead of providing a single pair of brackets [ ] we will use an additional set for each dimension past the first.

#If we wanted to access "Noelle"‘s height:

#Access the sublist at index 0, and then access the 1st index of that sublist. 
#noelles_height = heights[0][1] 
#print(noelles_height)
#Would output:

#61?

#Your code below:
class_name_test = [["Jenny",	90],["Alexus",	85.5],["Sam",	83],["Ellie",	101.5]]
print(class_name_test)
sams_score = [2][1]
print(sams_score)
ellies_score = class_name_test[-1][-1]
print(ellies_score)
