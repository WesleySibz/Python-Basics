#A list begins and ends with square brackets ([ and ]).
Each item (i.e., 67 or 70) is separated by a comma (,)
Itâ€™s considered good practice to insert a space () after each comma, 
but your code will run just fine if you forget the space.

heights = [61, 70, 67, 64, 65]

broken_heights = [65, 71, 59, 62]
