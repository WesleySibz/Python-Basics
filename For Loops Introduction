#for <temporary variable> in <collection>:
 #<action>
#Let’s break down each of these components:

#A for keyword indicates the start of a for loop.
#A <temporary variable> that is used to represent the value of the element in the collection the loop is currently on.
#An in keyword separates the temporary variable from the collection used for iteration.
#A <collection> to loop over. In our examples, we will be using a list.
#An <action> to do anything on each iteration of the loop.
#Let’s link these concepts back to our ingredients example. This for loop prints each ingredient in ingredients:

#ingredients = ["milk", "sugar", "vanilla extract", "dough", "chocolate"]
 
#for ingredient in ingredients:
  #print(ingredient)

#In this example:

#ingredient is the <temporary variable>.
#ingredients is our <collection>.
#print(ingredient) was the <action> performed on every iteration using the temporary variable of ingredient.
#This code outputs:

#milk
#sugar
#vanilla extract
#dough
#chocolate
