#The .pop() method takes an optional single input:

#The index for the element you want to remove.
#To see it in action, let’s consider a list called cs_topics that stores a collection of topics one might study in a computer science program.

#cs_topics = ["Python", "Data Structures", "Balloon Making", "Algorithms", "Clowns 101"]
#Two of these topics don’t look like they belong, let’s see how we remove them using .pop().

#First let’s remove "Clowns 101":

#removed_element = cs_topics.pop()
#print(cs_topics)print(removed_element)
#Would output:
#['Python', 'Data Structures', 'Balloon Making', 'Algorithms']
#'Clowns 101'

data_science_topics = ["Machine Learning", "SQL", "Pandas", "Algorithms", "Statistics", "Python 3"]
print(data_science_topics)

# Your code below: 
data_science_topics.pop()
print(data_science_topics)
data_science_topics.pop(3)
print(data_science_topics)
