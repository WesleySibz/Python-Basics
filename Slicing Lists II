#Take the list fruits as our example:

#fruits = ["apple", "cherry", "pineapple", "orange", "mango"]
#If we want to select the first n elements of a list, we could use the following code:

#fruits[:n]
#For our fruits list, suppose we wanted to slice the first three elements.

#The following code would start slicing from index 0 and up to index 3. Note that the fruit at index 3 (orange) is not included in the results.

#print(fruits[:3])
#Would output:

#['apple', 'cherry', 'pineapple']
#We can do something similar when we want to slice the last n elements in a list:

#fruits[-n:]
#For our fruits list, suppose we wanted to slice the last two elements.

#This code slices from the element at index -2 up through the last index.

#print(fruits[-2:])
#Would output:

#['orange', 'mango']
#Negative indices can also accomplish taking all but n last elements of a list.

#fruits[:-n]
#For our fruits example, suppose we wanted to slice all but the last element from the list.

#This example starts counting from the 0 index up to the element at index -1.

#print(fruits[:-1])
#Would output:

#['apple', 'cherry', 'pineapple', 'orange']

#suitcase = ["shirt", "shirt", "pants", "pants", "pajamas", "books"]

# Your code below: 
last_two_elements = suitcase[-2:]
print(last_two_elements)
slice_off_last_three  = suitcase[:-3]
print(slice_off_last_three)
