For example, range(2, 9) would generate numbers starting at 2 and ending at 8 (just before 9):

my_list = range(2, 9)
print(list(my_list))
Would output:

[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
If we use a third input, we can create a list that “skips” numbers.

For example, range(2, 9, 2) will give us a list where each number is 2 greater than the previous number:

my_range2 = range(2, 9, 2)
print(list(my_range2))
Would output:

[2, 4, 6, 8]

# Your code below: 

range_five_three = range(5, 15,3)
range_diff_five = range(0,40,5)
