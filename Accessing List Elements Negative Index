We can use the index -1 to select the last item of a list, 
even when we donâ€™t know how many elements are in a list.

shopping_list = ["eggs", "butter", "milk", "cucumbers", "juice", "cereal"]
last_element = (shopping_list[-1])
index5_element= (shopping_list[5])
print(last_element)
print(index5_element)
